I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. Prior to joining Berkeley, I was at Northwestern University as a post-doc. I completed my PhD at Cornell in 2015.

I study African politics with a focus on the political economy of development and state-society relations. To date, my research has focused on how interactions between state and social forces drive patterns of public goods provision and long-run development outcomes. I employ a range of methodologies to answer my research questions, from micro-level data to qualitative, case-study and archival research. My work has appeared in numerous outlets, including _Comparative Politics_, _Comparative Political Studies_, _Electoral Studies_, _The Quarterly Journal of Political Science_, _World Development_ and _World Politics_.  My book, _Precolonial Legacies in Postcolonial Politics_, was published in 2021 with Cambridge University Press.
