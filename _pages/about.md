I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. Prior to joining Berkeley, I held a post-doc at Northwestern University (2015-18). I completed my PhD at Cornell in 2015.

I study African Politics, with a focus on historical legacies, redistributive politics, and the local politics of development. To date, my research has focused on how state and developmental actions interact with grassroots social forces to shape local political and developmental outcomes. I employ a range of methodologies to answer my research questions, from survey data to qualitative, case-study and archival research. My work has appeared in numerous outlets, including __African Affairs_, _The American Political Science Review_, _Comparative Political Studies_, _Political Behavior_, _The Quarterly Journal of Political Science_, _World Development_ and _World Politics_.  My book, _Precolonial Legacies in Postcolonial Politics_, was published in 2021 with Cambridge University Press.
